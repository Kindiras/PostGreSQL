# `Database`:
   - it is an organized collection of data. 
## `Database Management System (DBMS)`
  - Special software program that helps users create and maintain a database.
## Two types of Database  
   - Relational Databases (`SQL`) => has rows and columns and a unique key identifier in each row.    
   - Non-Relational (`noSQL`) => JSON, XML, etc.
### Relational Database:
+ it links data in one table to related data in another table. 
     - A `table` is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
     - A `column` is property of a data table which stores and contains name or label or data type. 
     - A `row` is a single record in a table. 
#### `Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)` 
 + it helps users to create and maintain a relational database => mySQL,Oracle, postgreSQL, etc.
#### `Structured Query Language (SQL)`:
 + is a programming language designed to manage data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is managed by the American National Standards Institute [ANSI]  (https://www.ansi.org/).

#### `SQL is a hybrid of different types of languages in one`
 - `Data Query Language (DQL)`: used to get information that is already stored there. 
 - `Data Definition Language (DDL)` : Statements that define the database structure `CREATE`, `ALTER`,`DROP`.
 - `Data Control Language (DCL)` : Used to controlling access to the data in the database. 
 - `Data Manipulation Language (DML)`: Statements that manipulate data `SELECT`,`INSERT`,`UPDATE`, `DELETE`. 
 - `Transaction Control Language (TCL)`: Statements controlling the execution of the queries. (`Transaction` is a group of SQL statements as a single unit).
#### `Queries`
 + A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS.
